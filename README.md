# 🧵 Thread Visualization Dashboard

A beautiful, real-time web interface for visualizing recursive threading patterns with infinite depth and unlimited threads. This project provides an interactive GUI for demonstrating the exponential growth behavior of threads that spawn other threads recursively.

## 🎯 Overview

This project started as simple Python and Swift scripts that demonstrate recursive threading:
- Each thread spawns a child thread with `*` appended to its name
- Child threads continue spawning at increasing depths
- The pattern creates exponential thread growth
- Originally ran in infinite loops with no limits

The web GUI brings this concept to life with:
- **Real-time visualization** of thread hierarchies
- **Interactive controls** for managing the simulation
- **Performance optimizations** for handling infinite growth
- **Beautiful animations** and modern UI design

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Infinite Threading**: No artificial limits on thread count or depth
- ✅ **Recursive Spawning**: Each thread creates child threads with `*` naming pattern
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Live statistics and visualization
- ✅ **Exponential Growth**: Mirrors the original Python/Swift behavior

### Visualization Modes
- 🌳 **Tree View**: Visual node-based representation with animated connections
- 📜 **Log View**: Console-style output with syntax highlighting and timestamps
- 🎨 **Color Coding**: Different colors for different thread depths
- ⚡ **Smooth Animations**: Nodes appear/disappear with transitions

### Interactive Controls
- ▶️ **Start/Pause/Reset**: Full control over the simulation
- 🎛️ **Speed Control**: Adjust thread creation interval (100-2000ms)
- 🔧 **Depth Limits**: Set maximum recursion depth (0 = infinite)
- 📊 **Thread Limits**: Set maximum thread count (0 = infinite)

### Performance Features
- 🧹 **Auto Cleanup**: Removes old threads to prevent memory overflow
- 📈 **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in FPS monitoring
- 🎯 **Smart Limits**: Visual node limits for smooth rendering
- ⚠️ **Safety Warnings**: Alerts about exponential growth

### User Experience
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Spacebar (start/pause), Ctrl+R (reset), Ctrl+T (toggle view)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds
- 🌙 **Professional Theme**: Dark log view with syntax highlighting

- JavaScript enabled

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Controls
1. **Start Button**: Begin the thread simulation
2. **Pause Button**: Temporarily stop thread creation
3. **Reset Button**: Clear all threads and start fresh

### Settings Configuration
- **Speed Slider**: Control how fast threads are created (100-2000ms intervals)
- **Max Depth**: Set recursion limit (0 = infinite depth)
- **Max Threads**: Set total thread limit (0 = unlimited threads)

### View Modes
- **Tree View**: Visual representation with nodes and connections
- **Log View**: Text-based console output with timestamps

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Spacebar`: Toggle start/pause
- `Ctrl/Cmd + R`: Reset simulation
- `Ctrl/Cmd + T`: Switch between tree/log view

### Understanding the Output
- **Root Threads**: `Thread-0`, `Thread-1`, etc.
- **Child Threads**: `Thread-0*`, `Thread-0**`, etc.
- **Depth Levels**: Color-coded by recursion depth
- **Statistics**: Real-time counts and runtime tracking

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Infinite Mode (Default)
```javascript
maxDepth: Infinity     // Unlimited recursion depth
maxThreads: Infinity   // Unlimited thread count
```

### Performance Settings
```javascript
maxVisualizationNodes: 200    // Limit visual nodes
maxLogEntries: 500           // Limit log entries  
cleanupInterval: 5000        // Cleanup every 5 seconds
```

### Speed Settings
```javascript
speed: 500              // Default thread creation interval (ms)
minSpeed: 100          // Fastest setting
maxSpeed: 2000         // Slowest setting
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Thread Simulation Logic
The simulation replicates the original Python/Swift behavior:

1. **Main Loop**: Continuously creates root threads (`Thread-N`)
2. **Recursive Spawning**: Each thread creates a child with `*` appended
3. **Depth Tracking**: Monitors maximum recursion depth reached
4. **Lifecycle Management**: Threads are created, spawn children, then terminate

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old threads
- **Visual Limits**: Caps on displayed nodes for smooth rendering  
- **Efficient Updates**: Batched DOM updates and smart re-rendering
- **Background Cleanup**: Periodic garbage collection

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full support with all features
- **Firefox**: Full support with all features
- **Safari**: Full support with all features
- **Edge**: Full support with all features

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Infinite Mode Warning
When using infinite settings (depth=0, threads=0):
- Threads will grow **exponentially** fast
- Memory usage will increase rapidly
- Browser may slow down or become unresponsive
- Use **Pause** button if performance degrades

### Performance Recommendations
- Start with limited settings first
- Monitor browser memory usage
- Use cleanup features to maintain performance
- Close other browser tabs when running infinite mode

### Safety Features
- Automatic cleanup prevents complete memory overflow
- Visual warnings about exponential growth
- Easy pause/reset controls for quick recovery
- Performance monitoring built-in

## 🧪 Original Implementations

### Python Version (`threads.py`)
```python
import threading
import time

i = 0

def moving_thread(name, depth=0):
    print(f"Thread {name} at depth {depth}")
    t = threading.Thread(target=moving_thread, args=(name+"*", depth+1))
    t.start()

# Start initial threads
while True:
    t = threading.Thread(target=moving_thread, args=(f"Thread-{i}",))
    t.start()
    i += 1
```

### Swift Version (`threads.swift`)
```swift
import Foundation
import Dispatch

var i = 0

func movingThread(name: String, depth: Int = 0) {
    print("Thread \(name) at depth \(depth)")
    
    let thread = Thread {
        movingThread(name: name + "*", depth: depth + 1)
    }
    thread.start()
}

// Start initial threads in an infinite loop
while true {
    let thread = Thread {
        movingThread(name: "Thread-\(i)")
    }
    thread.start()
    i += 1
}
```
